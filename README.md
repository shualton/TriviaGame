I created an object of questions which held information for all of the questions used in the quiz including their answers. I also created a timer that would count down from 1 minute. I then had the user select an answer choice for each question, and then used a for loop to traverse each question to see if the slected answer was the right choice. If so, the correct answer counter would increase and if not the wrong answer counter would increase. When the quiz was finished, the html page would fade to a new containter containing the user's score. If the time ran out, the quiz would automatically end and all unaswered questions would be counted as incorrect.
